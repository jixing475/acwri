~~Acne vulgaris is a common chronic inflammatory disorder of the pilosebaceous unit (1). Its pathogenesis involves the interplay of increased sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, shifts in the skin microbiome, and innate and adaptive immune responses (2). Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) is highly ~~abundant in lipid-rich follicles and is closely implicated in lesion initiation and persistence. C. acnes lipases hydrolyze triglycerides to free fatty acids that perturb barrier function and keratinization (3); cell wall components and metabolites activate pattern-recognition pathways (e.g., TLR2, NLRP3) to drive IL‑1β and IL‑8 production; and biofilm formation and strain-level heterogeneity have been associated with clinical phenotypes and treatment responses (4, 5). Clinical experience and guidelines indicate that acne vulgaris can be mitigated by interventions that suppress or eliminate C. acnes, thereby reducing inflammation and new lesions. For example, Benzoyl peroxide releases reactive oxygen species within the follicular environment and rapidly lowers C. acnes counts (6, 7). Topical clindamycin and erythromycin, and oral tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline, inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by targeting the ribosome (8, 9) and are widely used across disease severities. These examples support a rationale for discovery strategies that directly inhibit C. acnes as a component of acne vulgaris management.
